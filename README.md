# RPi4_NextCloud_Raid1
Raspberry Pi 4 Nextcloud server with RAID 1 for redundancy

## Introduction
In this repo I will describe, step-by-step, how to setup a NextCloud server using a Rasberry Pi 4. The setup will also include two 2 TB hard drives arranged in a RAID 1 configuation for redundancy. The sections below include detailed instructions and photos for each step

## Hardware
In this section all the equipment used for this project is listed. Next to each component there is also a link for the purchase webpage.

* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Starter Kit (It includes the Raspberry Pi board, a 5.1 V power supply, a HDMI to micro HDMI cable, a raspberry pi case and a 32 GB micro SD card) ([Link](https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-kits-and-bundles/products/raspberry-pi-starter-kit))
* 4-Piece Raspberry Pi 4 Heatsink Set ([Link](https://thepihut.com/products/4-piece-raspberry-pi-4-heatsink-set))

## Procedure

### Installing Heatsinks
Installing the heatsinks is an optional step and it is pretty staightforward. Check the photo below (taken from the pihut website) to see which heatsink goes to each component. Then just remove the protective cover sheet and stick the heatsink on top of the component. After finishing that you can put the Raspberry Pi board in the case for protection.
